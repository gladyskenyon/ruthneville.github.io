<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> My name is Ruth Neville and I am a first year CDT student studying towards an MSc and PhD in Data Analytics and Society.<br>  
My research project is based on predicting future demand for UK higher education from international students. My partner is UCAS and I am excited to start working with them.<br>
