<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> My name is Ruth Neville and I am a first year CDT student studying towards an MSc and PhD in Data Analytics and Society.<br> 
  <br>
My research project is based on predicting future demand for UK higher education from international students. My partner is UCAS and I am excited to start working with them.<br>
  <br>
My background is in Political Science, and in my spare time I still like to keep up with electoral politics and research on sociological drivers for voting behaviour. </p>
