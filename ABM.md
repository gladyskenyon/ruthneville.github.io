<h2> What is an ABM? </h2> 

<p> ABM stands for an Agent Based Model. An ABM allows a researcher to simulate actions of agents and measure their behaviour and outcomes over time (Crooks and Heppenstall, 2012, p.86). The key elements of an ABM are the model, the agent, and the envrionment. The model deals with the user and sets up the model, running the model iterations and stopping conditions. The agent includes the agent's behaviour and records of their state. The environment represents the 'world' that agents may interact with. </p> 

<h2> GEOG5995M - Practical 1 </h2> 

<p> For my first assignment I was asked to create an ABM to simulate sheep grazing in a field. This was my first time ever using Python, and my first introduction to programming. </p> 

<p> I was successful in creating a model which simulated sheep grazing in an environment with other sheep, with each sheep being aware of others around them and only eating until their stomach's were full. I was able to animate the model. Please see the below static image of the output, which ideally I would present animated here!</p>
